I will upgrade RAM and hard disk and add external keyboard and mouse. The Ram up-gradation is straight forward where I will replace the two RAM slots. For hard disk I will keep the existing one (500 GB) in its slot and replace the optical drive with an SSD drive. I will consider the most valuable external keyboard and mouse for up-gradation.
